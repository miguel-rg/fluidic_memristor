# Phenomenological Model for a Fluidic Memristor


This repository contains the necessary code to reproduce the theoretical results included in the paper:

**The fluidic memristor: collective phenomena in elastohydrodynamic networks**

Alejandro Martinez-Calvo, Matthew D Biviano, Anneline Christensen, Eleni Katifori, Kaare H Jensen, Miguel Ruiz-Garcia


For simplicity, we have uploaded a Colab Notebook that reproduces the main result of the paper:
